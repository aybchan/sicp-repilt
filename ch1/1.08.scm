#| Exercise 1.8
 | Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an 
 | approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given 
 | by the value
 |
 | ( x / (y^2) + 2y) / 3
 | 
 | Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the 
 | square-root procedure.
